Added
-----

- Add support for ``Wagtail 2.12``.
- Added an option to customize Customer formatting in admin, see: :ref:`admin-customer-formatter`.
- Added ``name`` and ``code`` properties on Basket item to make it consistent with Order item.
- Added the ability to override order serializer, see: :ref:`custom-order-serializer`.
- Add custom basket item validation, see: :ref:`basket-item-validator`.

Changed
-------

- Extra field on basket now always defaults to ``{}`` so that the validator gets called when empty.

Fixed
-----

- Allow ``OrderViewSet`` to be called without a ``lookup_field`` to fix schema generation.
- Ensure that ``ProductField`` has ``request`` available through context.
- Optimize basket by prefetching the related products in ``get_items``.
- Optimize order views by pre-fetching related data.
